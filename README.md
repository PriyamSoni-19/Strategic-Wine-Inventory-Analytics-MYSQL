# Strategic-Wine-Inventory-Analytics-MYSQL  

## Welcome  

Vineyard Management is a complete SQL database project created as part of my coursework in Business Information Systems.  
What began as a messy spreadsheet and assignment specification has been transformed into a fully structured relational database with:  

- Clean and standardized data  
- A documented schema with clear relationships  
- A set of insightful analytical reports  

To get started with the schema and queries, follow the instructions provided below.  
## Getting Started  

To get started with this project → install **MySQL** on your system → download the final SQL file from this repository → open it in **MySQL Workbench** → run the file to create the full database with all tables, data, views, and queries → once set up, run the queries to explore the business insights → finally, access the **ER Diagram** by using the *Reverse Engineer* option in MySQL Workbench after loading the file.  

## Course Description  
The course focused on relational modelling, SQL, and database applications in business.  
Key skills included designing data models, applying integrity constraints, retrieving insights using SQL, and understanding database concepts such as security, concurrency, and data integrity.

## Project Iterations  
- **Iteration 1:** Designed schema (wines, suppliers, customers, orders)  
- **Iteration 2:** Cleaned and standardised raw data  
- **Iteration 3:** Built Q1–Q8 queries for insights  
- **Iteration 4:** Added sustainability reports & documentation

## Description  
The **SQL Vineyard Case Study** was a **group project** where we transformed messy business data into a structured relational database.  
It included schema design, data cleaning, analytical queries, and sustainability reporting — demonstrating how SQL can deliver valuable insights for business decision-making.  

## ER Diagram Overview

This **Entity Relationship Diagram** represents the integrated data structure of a winery management system.

It maps the relationships between key business entities — **vineyards, grape varieties, wine production, suppliers, employees, transport, and inventory**.  
Each table captures specific operational details such as **vineyard locations, grape harvests, supplier orders, and product bottling**.

Together, these relationships provide a unified view of the winery’s operations — from **grape cultivation to finished wine distribution** — ensuring efficient **data management, traceability, and process control** across the entire supply chain.


## Value  
This project shows how SQL can be used to turn messy data into something useful and reliable.  
It goes beyond just building a database — it’s about creating insights that help in real business decisions.  
The work reflects practical skills in data management and problem-solving that are valuable in consulting, analytics, and business roles.
